📥 Usage

You can clone this repository to your local machine or download the files and simulate or run them in your preferred environment.

git clone https://github.com/daddys-dispatch/college_ddco.git

For Verilog/VHDL-based Simulations:

Use any compatible simulation software such as Xilinx ISE, ModelSim, or Quartus.

1. Import the code file into the software.


2. Simulate the design and observe the waveforms.



For Assembly Programs (8086/8051):

Use MASM, TASM, or any 8086 emulator to compile and execute.

masm FileName.asm
link FileName.obj
FileName.exe
